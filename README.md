# pyUpscaleK: Efficient Groundwater Flow (Hydraulic Conductivity) Upscaling Tool with a spectral approach

Prepared by Young-Ho Seo and Harry Lee for a manuscript "Development of a reliable hydraulic conductivity upscaling tool for high dimensional groundwater flow models." Collaboration with Peter Kitanidis and Massimo Rolle.

1. python code for K upscaling using a spectral approach
1. python code for MODFLOW6 to simulate groundwater flow with anisotropic K tensors (using USGS Flopy). 

The complete code with documentation will be uploaded soon.
